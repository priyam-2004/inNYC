  <pre>More Info</pre>  

<p> This is a brand redesign project I completed during my freshman year for the "Product, Promotion, and Packaging" class. The goal was to give an evergreen brand like Barilla a fresh look from a Gen Z perspective. The original brand colors were retained to ensure recognizability on the shelf, while the updated font, logo, and packaging were designed to appeal to college students aged 18-25. </p>

<p> For the logo redesign, I decided to keep the original colors after careful consideration. Initially, I chose existing typefaces that resonate with Gen Z, but eventually, I sketched my own design, scanned it, and digitized it in Illustrator. I also introduced a mascot for the brand, resulting in whimsical packaging with different characters corresponding to various pasta shapes, inspired by Barilla’s “Intensely Italian” campaign. Additionally, I added fun elements to the side panels of the packaging to make it stand out further on the shelf. </p>

<p> For the merchandise design, I maintained a similar style but aimed for a more generic, useable look. I achieved this with a retro poster featuring a homely bowl of pasta. For social media campaigns, I researched Gen Z interactions and found that they engage with filters and challenges. This inspired me to create a "Guess the Pasta" filter, launching the #BarillaChallenge. </p>
