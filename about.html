        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I‚Äôm Priyamvada‚Äîthough you can call me Priyam. I‚Äôm a passionate graphic designer currently studying at Parsons School of Design in New York City. My favorite fonts are ABC Arizona and Hatton (serif) and Montserrat (sans serif), a reflection of my love for typography and its role in visual storytelling.
        </p>
        <p>
            This website is more than just a portfolio; it‚Äôs an immersive exploration of my life in New York‚Äîa city that has become my muse. Here, you‚Äôll find glimpses of my journey through art, design projects, photographs I‚Äôve captured, essays I‚Äôve written, and my favorite restaurants. It‚Äôs a mosaic of my hobbies and interests, an intimate showcase of the things I love most.
        </p>
        <p>
            The design of my website draws deeply from my identity. The color palette of rani pink and yellow reflects both my heritage and my personality. Rani pink, with its deep connection to Indian festivals and traditions, symbolizes home, while yellow embodies joy and optimism. Together, they create a playful, bubbly atmosphere balanced by a mature sensibility.
        </p>

        <h2>My New York Journey</h2>
        <p>
            Scattered throughout the site, you‚Äôll notice pink rats scurrying across the pages‚Äîa whimsical nod to New York‚Äôs unofficial mascot. These little creatures embody the city‚Äôs grit, charm, and unpredictability, much like my own experience of adapting to life here.
        </p>
        <p>
            But the rats on my site are more than visual quirks‚Äîthey're part of an interactive game I created called Rat Runner. On the landing page, you‚Äôll encounter a game where a rat navigates its way through obstacles shaped like rat traps. By pressing the space bar, you can make the rat jump over these traps, dodging them to move ahead. Miss a jump, and the game ends‚Äîbut you can always restart. This game is symbolic of my journey in New York: a constant dance of overcoming obstacles. Sometimes, I stumble. But like the rat, I pick myself up, restart, and keep moving forward.
        </p>
        <p>
            New York has a way of inspiring you when you least expect it‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs through the art in its museums, the stories in its streets, or even the bustling energy of its iconic subways. This city has shaped my creative process, and this website is my way of celebrating that. It‚Äôs an invitation to explore not just my work but also my perspective as a designer navigating the dynamic rhythm of New York.
