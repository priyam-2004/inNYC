      <p> Parallel lives; an idea that a person’s life can exist in multiple versions simultaneously, each with its own experiences and outcomes. The funny part about a shift of any form, emotional or physical, is that one tries to find parallels with their previous life —a life that one has "shifted" from. This phenomenon often occurs subconsciously, as the human psyche seeks comfort in the most unusual ways. Throughout my life, I've comfortably created parallels during various transitions, whether it was moving homes, leaving my joint family, or experiencing my brother's departure for college. Each change and shift had its parallel situation that brought me comfort, serving as a constant thread in the tapestry of my life. However, when I moved to New York, this trend seemed to break. </p> 

      <p> New York City became a shift that, initially, appeared to have no parallels. I was overwhelmed and scared, stepping off the airport ramp into a world unlike any I had ever known. The city greeted me with parks filled with artists, the strum of guitars strings, and “bubblemen” enchanting children. It was a stark contrast to the vast patches of green, framed with dark wood and the chromatic butterflies that were familiar to me. I had left behind moss-covered reflections and cranes landing on their prey. The only clinginess I had witnessed was among apes holding onto their kind for protection.</p> 

      <p> Food trucks lined the streets, a sight unfamiliar to me, as my previous experience consisted of grab-and-go tiny huts that I loved for. Suited bikers and elegantly dressed women on their way to work replaced the image of people in suits driving cars and trench coats in Ubers. The city unraveled a humbling experience that differed from the glamorous, rom-com portrayal I had anticipated. </p> 

      <p> I had never imagined that spray painting on a wall wouldn't lead to an arrest; my familiarity with such art was limited to mesmerizing depictions of holy gods and symbols that garnered blessings. The concept of street art and its freedom of expression was entirely alien to me. </p>

      <p> As time passed, I began to realize that the illustrations of my mind were more parallel than I initially thought. The parks, despite their differences, had a vibrant form of life that resonated with the vibrancy of nature that I had known back home. The parks here were filled with music and smiles, much like the birds and butterflies that fluttered around in my previous space. The art, no matter how divergent in style, brought people together, conveying ideas and emotions that resonated deeply with society. I discovered that my love for a grab-and-go bagel oozing with cream cheese mirrored my love for the familiar grab-and-go food from my past. The concept of "ekla cholo" (walking alone) resonated deeply with me here, where the idea that if nobody walks by your side, you walk alone, and the people will follow became a guiding philosophy. The path to success and pride remained the same; all I needed was myself. Another parallel was me. Everything in my life might have changed, but I remained a constant amidst the shifting sands. </p>

      <p> Just like the binding of a book, I realized that I was the constant thread weaving through the pages of my life. With each flip of the page there are different words, and a new chapter begins just as is in my life and without the binding, any book would be a disjointed mess with no constant flow. In New York City, I discovered that even in a world of shifting realities and unfamiliar surroundings, I could find parallels within myself. I was the bridge that connected the old and the new, the known and the unknown, creating a blend of experiences and memories that formed the new tapestry of my life. </p>

      <p> As I continued to navigate the bustling streets and diverse neighborhoods of New York, I realized that finding parallels was never just about seeking comfort in new surroundings; it was about embracing change while holding onto the core of one's identity. In the city that never sleeps, where every corner holds a new adventure and every face tells a different story, I found my own parallel life—a life that is constantly evolving, yet anchored by the unchanging essence of who I am. </p>
